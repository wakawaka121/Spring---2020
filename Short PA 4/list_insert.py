"""list_insert.py - A couple of simple list functions

Author: Russ Lewis

Declares sorted_list_insert() and list_print(), both of which are fairly
simple list functions.  This exists primarily as a set of code that
students will use to practice doing code coverage.

Note that the insert function assumes that every value inserted is a two
element tuple, where the second element is the primary search key, and the
first element is a secondary search key.

ALSO NOTE: This is intentionally suboptimal code!  To make the code coverage
           problem a little more interesting, I have *intentionally* split,
           into multiple cases, things which I ordinarily would combine into
           simpler, unified cases!
