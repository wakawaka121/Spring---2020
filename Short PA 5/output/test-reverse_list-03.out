Testing reverse_list()...

Input list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

------------ PERFORMING THE CALL ... ------------
--- BEFORE THE LOOP ---
original list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

old: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
new: 1

old: 3 -> 4 -> 5
new: 2 -> 1

old: 4 -> 5
new: 3 -> 2 -> 1

old: 5
new: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

old: None
new: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

------------ CALL HAS RETURNED ------------

Returned list: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Checking to make sure that all of the nodes in the output list are
from the input list.  If you see a failure reported here, then
it's likely that you did one or more of the following:
   - Created new nodes, instead of just changing the references
   - Swapped values between nodes
 ... Checking ...
Output list node check complete.
