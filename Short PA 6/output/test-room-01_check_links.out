TESTING A SIMPLE 3x5 GRID.  DO ALL OF THE LINKS POINT AS I EXPECT?

Calling build_grid(3,5)...

Extracting all of the rooms into 15 different variables.  If any of these fail because of a None pointer, then it means that your grid is too small.

Checking to make sure that all of the edge links are None.  These use assert statements ... so any failure here will be repored as an AssertionError; if you see that, then you should figure out which line failed, and look into that issue.

Checking the *internal* links, to ensure that they are all correct.  Just like the previous test, this uses assertions.

No errors detectedd.
